# How do Cells Respond to Different Drug Treatments?

In the ipynb file 'projectcode', you will find our analysis of 2.8K cell images treated with a variety of around 300 drugs. We walk through our analysis, starting from the segmentation of the images using Cellpose, to feature extraction from the segmented images, to dimension reduction and clustering methods, and finally to the training of two classification models (multinomial logistic regression and random forest classifier).

The original images can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11ZoNN19_mOWqsxEUjTFNVEuqMJhrPRYe?usp=share_link).

The masks we outputted can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-B7AsFDT5foG9tlrjKLMO_4n4uLiLCn7?usp=sharing).
